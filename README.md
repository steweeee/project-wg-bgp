A high-availability WireGuard VPN cluster with automatic failover and optimized routing using BGP and keepalived.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project implements a resilient VPN infrastructure consisting of:

- **4 Virtual Machines**: 3 nodes with public IP addresses (gateway nodes) + 1 internal node without public IP
- **Full Mesh WireGuard Network**: Every node connects to every other node for maximum redundancy
- **BGP Dynamic Routing**: Optimizes packet routing between peers automatically
- **Keepalived High Availability**: Ensures automatic failover when nodes become unavailable
